    <h1>Difference between http1.1 and http2</h1>
    <h2>HTTP1.1</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>It supports connection reuse i.e. for every TCP connection there could be multiple requests and responses, and pipelining where the client can request several resources from the server at once. However, pipelining was hard to implement due to issues such as head-of-line blocking and was not a feasible solution.</li>
            <li>Introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about the status of a message. Can define 24 status codes, error reporting is quicker and more efficient.</li>
            <li>It is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication, NTLM authentication.</li>
            <li>Expands on the caching support by using additional headers like cache-control, conditional headers like If-Match and by using entity tags.</li>
            <li>HTTP/1.1 provides faster delivery of web pages and reduces web traffic as compared to HTTP/1.0. However, TCP starts slowly and with domain sharding (resources can be downloaded simultaneously by using multiple domains), connection reuse and pipelining, there is an increased risk of network congestion.</li>    
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>HTTP2</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses multiplexing, where over a single TCP connection resources to be delivered are interleaved and arrive at the client almost at the same time. It is done using streams which can be prioritized, can have dependencies and individual flow control. It also provides a feature called server push that allows the server to send data that the client will need but has not yet requested.</li>
            <li>Underlying semantics of HTTP such as headers, status codes remains the same.</li>
            <li>Security concerns from previous versions will continue to be seen in HTTP/2. However, it is better equipped to deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type Inadequate_Security.</li>
            <li>HTTP/2 does not change much in terms of caching. With the server push feature if the client finds the resources are already present in the cache, it can cancel the pushed stream.</li>
            <li>HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time by a greater margin along with being less sensitive to network delays.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Objects in Javascript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. </p>
    <p>Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.

        In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.</p>
        <p>Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let's create an object named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:<br/>
         
       <br/>
           const myCar = {<br/>
                make: 'Ford',<br/>
                model: 'Mustang',<br/>
                year: 1969<br/>
              };</p>
